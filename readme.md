This is a sandwich style acrylic case generated with the swilkb plate/case generator. I've modified it to have a stepped upper two layers - each layer recesses in two mm to give a nice stepped look. Addtionally, I modified the stabilizer cutout to make it easy to change or remove the stabilizer. 

I cut my case using different widths of acrylic.

Top layer: 5mm
Plate layer: 3mm
Open Layer: 5mm
Closed Layer: 5mm
Bottom Layer: 5mm

If you choose to use other widths of acrylic be aware you will need at least two open layers, if not three. I am using a very narrow USB-C cable and it barely squeaks by in the current config.

The holes accept M2 stand offs with M2 screws or M3 screws without stand offs.

If you need an elevated typing angle, I suggest purchasing some aluminum feet and VHB tape or just bump-ons.
