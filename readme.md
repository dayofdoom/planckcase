This is a sandwich style acrylic case generated with the swilkb plate/case generator. I've modified it to have a stepped upper two layers - each layer recesses in two mm to give a nice stepped look. Addtionally, I modified the stabilizer cutout to make it easy to change or remove the stabilizer. 

I cut my case using different widths of acrylic.

Layer_4 (158.6mm x 106.2mm)- (Top layer): 5mm
Layer_3 (262.6mm x 110.2mm)- (Plate layer): 3mm
Layer_2 (266.6mm x 114.2mm) - (Open Layer): 5mm
Layer_1 (266.6mm x 114.2mm) - (Closed Layer): 5mm
Layer_0 (266.6mm x 114.2mm) - (Bottom Layer): 5mm

If you're cutting this yourself or using Ponoko, make sure the width and heights of each of the layers match what's listed above.

If you choose to use other widths of acrylic (or even the exact same) be aware you will need at least two open layers, if not three. I am using a very narrow USB-C cable and it barely squeaks by in the current config.

The holes accept M2 stand offs with M2 screws or M3 screws without stand offs.

If you need an elevated typing angle, I suggest purchasing some aluminum feet and VHB tape or just bump-ons.

This case has been tested with a JNAO PCB but should work with a Planck PCB because they are identical as far as I know.
